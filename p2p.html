<h1>ProActive Peer-to-Peer
Infrastructure</h1>
<p>Computational Peer-To-Peer
(P2P) is becoming a key execution environment. The potential of 100,000
of nodes interconnected to execute a single application is rather
appealing, especially for Grid computing. Mimicking data P2P, one could
start a computation that no failure would ever be able to stop (and
maybe nobody).</p>
<p>The ProActive P2P aims to use
spare CPU cycles from organizations or institution's desktop
workstations.</p>
<p>This short document explains
how to create a simple computational P2P network. This network is a
dynamic JVMs network which works like, computational nodes.</p>
<p>The P2P infrastructure works as
an overlay network. It works with a <b>P2P
Service</b> which is a peer which in
turn is computational node. The P2P Service is implemented with a
ProActive JVM and few Actives Objects. The next figure shows an example
of a network of hosts where some JVMs are running and several of them
are running the P2P Service.</p>
<div align="center"> <img src="p2p_files/overlaynetwork.jpg"

<p><b class="legend">Example of a ProActive P2P
infrastructure.</b></p>
</div>
<p>When the P2P infrastructure is
running, it is very easy to obtain some nodes (JVMs). The next section
describes how to use it.</p>
<p>Further research informations
are available <a

</ul>
<!--+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++-->
<h2><a name="network"></a>Create
your P2P Network</h2>
<p>The P2P infrastructure is
self-organized and configurable. When the infrastructure is running you
have nothing to do to keep it up. There are 3 parameters to configure:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li><b>Time
To Update (TTU)</b>: each peer
checks if its known peers are available when TTU expires. By default,
its value is 1 minutes.</li>
  <li><b>Number
Of Acquaintances (NOA)</b>: is the
minimal number of peers one peer needs to know to keep up the
infrastructure. By default, its value is 10 peers.</li>
  <li><b>Time
To Live (TTL)</b>: in hops for JVMs
(node) depth search (acquisition). By default, its value is 5 hops.</li>
</ul>
<p>All parameters description and
how to change theirs default values are explained <a
 href="Configuration.html#p2p_properties">here</a>.
Next section shows how to configure the infrastructure when starting
the P2P Service with the command line.</p>
<p>The bootstrapping or first
contact problem is how a new peer can join the p2p infrastructure. We
solved this problem by just specifying one or several addresses of
supposed peers which are running in the p2p infrastructure. Next, we
will explain how and where you can specify this list of peers.</p>
<p>Now, you have just to start
peers. There are two ways to do it:</p>
<h3>Quick Start Peer</h3>
<p>This method explains how to
rapidly launch a simple P2P Service on one host.</p>
<p>ProActive provides a very
simple <i>script</i>
to start a P2P Service on your local host. The name of this script is <b>startP2PService</b>.</p>
<ul>
  <li> UNIX, GNU/Linux, BSD and
MacOsX systems: the script is located in <code>ProActive/p2p/scripts/unix/startP2PService.sh</code>
file.</li>
  <li> Microsoft Windows system:
the script is located in <code>
ProActive/p2p/scripts/windows/startP2PService.bat</code>
file.</li>
</ul>
<p>Before launching this script,
you have to specify some arguments to this command:</p>
<p><b>startP2PService</b>
<code>[-acq acquisitionMethod]
[-port portNumber] [-s Peer ...] [-f PeersListFile]</code></p>
<ul>
  <li> <b>-acq acquisitionMethod</b>
the ProActive Runtime communication protocol used. Examples: rmi, http,
ibis,
... By default it is <i>rmi</i>.</li>
  <li> <b>-port portNumber</b>
is the port number where the P2P Service will listen. By default it is <i>2410</i></li>
  <li> <b>-s
Peer ...</b> specify addresses of
peers which use to join the P2P infrastructure. Example: <code>rmi://applepie.proactive.org:8080</code></li>
  <li> <b>-f
PeersListFile</b> same of <code>-s</code>
but peers are specified in file <code>ServerListFile</code>.
One by line.</li>
</ul>
<p>More options:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>-noa
NOA</b> in number of host. NOA is
the minimal number of peers one peer
needs to know to keep up the
infrastructure. By default, its value is 10 peers.</li>
  <li><b>-ttu
TTU</b> is in minutes.&nbsp;
Each peer
sends an heart beat to its
acquaintances.
By default, its value is 1 minutes.</li>
  <li><b>-ttl
TTL</b> is in hop. TTL represents
messages live time in hops of JVMs
(node). By default, its
value is 5 hops.</li>
  <li><b>-capacity
Number_of_Messages</b> is the
maximum memory size to stock message UUID.
Default value is 1000
messages UUID.</li>
  <li><b>-exploring
Percentage</b> is the percentage of
agree response when peer is looking for
acquaintances. By default, its value is 66%.</li>
  <li><b>-booking
Time</b> in ms which uses during
booking a shared node. It's the maximum
time in millisecond
to create at less an active object in the shared node. After this time
and if no active objects are created the shared node will leave and the
peer which gets this shared node will be not enable to use it more.
Default is 3 minutes.</li>
  <li><b>-node_acq
Time</b> in milliseconds which is
the timeout for node
acquisition. The default value is 3 minutes.</li>
  <li><b>-lookup
Time</b> is the lookup frequency in
milliseconds for re-asking nodes. By default, it's value is 30 seconds.</li>
  <li><b>-no_multi_proc_nodes</b> to share only a node. Otherwise, 1
node by CPU that means the p2p service which is running on a bi-pro
will share 2 nodes. By default, 1 shared node for 1 CPU.</li>
</ul>
<p>All arguments are optional.</p>
<p><b>Comment:
</b>With the UNIX version of the
startP2PService script, the P2P service is persistent and runs like a
UNIX <i>nice</i>
process. If the JVMs that are running the P2P service stop (for a Java
exception) the script re-starts a new one.</p>
<h4>Usage Example</h4>
<p>In this illustration, we will
explain how to start a first peer and thenafter how new peers can
create a P2P network with the first one.</p>
<p>Start the first peer with <i>rmi</i>
protocol and listening on port <i>2410</i>:</p>
<code>first.peer.host$
startP2PService.sh rmi 2410</code>
<p>Now, start new peers and
connect them to the first peer to create a tiny P2P network:</p>
<code>second.peer.host$
startP2PService.sh rmi 2410 -s rmi://first.peer.host</code>
<p></p>
<code> third.peer.host$
startP2PService.sh rmi 2602 -s rmi://first.peer.host</code>
<p>You could specify different
port number for each peer.</p>
<p>Use a file to specify address
of peers:</p>
<p>The file <i>hosts.file</i>:</p>
<pre> rmi://first.peer.host:2410<br> rmi://third.peer.host:2602<br></pre>
<code> file.peer.host$
startP2PService.sh rmi 8989 -f hosts.file</code>
<p>Last, a new peer joins the P2P
network by another peer of the first:</p>
<code>last.peer.host$
startP2PService.sh rmi 6666 -s rmi://third.peer.host:2410</code>

<p><b class="legend">Usage example P2P network (after
firsts connections).</b></p>
</div>
<h3>The P2P Daemon</h3>
<p>The daemon aim to use computers
in Peer-to-Peer computations, there will be a Java virtual machine
sleeping on your computers and waking up at scheduled times to get some
work done.</p>
<p>By default, the JVM is
scheduled to wake up during the weekend and during the night. Next, we
will explain how to change the schedule. The JVM is running with the
lowest priority.</p>
<h4>Installation</h4>
<h5>UNIX</h5>
<p>Go to the directory: <code>ProActive/compile</code>
and run this command:</p>
<code>$ ./build daemon</code>
<p>Before compile you should
change some parameter like the daemon user or the port in the file: <code>ProActive/p2p/src/common/proactivep2p.h</code>.</p>
<p>Ask to your system
administrator to add the daemon in a crontab or init.d. The process to
run is located here: <code>ProActive/p2p/build/proactivep2p</code></p>
<h5>Micorsoft Windows</h5>
<p>To compile daemon source (in
c++), we don't porvide any automatic script, you have to do it by
yourself. All sources for Windows are in the directory: <code>ProActive/p2p/src/windows</code>.
If you use Visual Studio or else in the same directory you found
Microsoft projects files.</p>
<p>After that you are ready to
install the daemon with Windows, you have jsut to run this script:</p>
<code>C:&gt;
ProActive\p2p\scripts\windows\Service\install.bat</code>
<p>To remove the daemon:</p>
<code>C:&gt;
ProActive\p2p\scripts\windows\Service\remove.bat</code>
<p><b>Comment</b>:
By default the port number of the daemon is <b>9015</b>.</p>
<h4>Configuration</h4>
<p>The daemon is configured with
XML files in the <code>ProActive/p2p/config/</code>
directory. To find the correct configuration file, the daemon will
first try with a host dependant file: <code>config/proactivep2p.${HOST}.xml</code>
for example: <code>config/proactivep2p.camel.inria.fr.xml</code>
if the daemon is running on the host named <code>camel.inria.fr.</code></p>
<p>If this host specific file is
not found, the daemon will load <code>config/proactivep2p.xml</code>.
This mechanism can be useful to setup a default configuration and have
a specific configuration for some hosts.</p>
<p>The reference is the XML Schema
in <a href="p2p_files/proactivep2p.xsd">proactivep2p.xsd</a>.
For those not fluent in XML Schema, here is a description of every
markup tags--</p>
<p>The root element in <b>&lt;configFile&gt;</b>
it contains one or many <b>&lt;p2pconfig&gt;</b>
. This latter element can start with some <b>&lt;loadconfig
path="path/to/xml"/&gt;</b> they
will include the designated XML file. After these file inclusions, you
can with <b>&lt;host
name="name.domain"&gt;</b>
specify which hosts are concerned by the configuration. Then there can
be a <b>&lt;configForHost&gt;</b>
element containing a configuration for the selected hosts and/or a <b>&lt;default&gt;</b>
element if no suitable configuration was already found.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that the XML
parser sees a lot of configuration and the first that matches is used
and the parsing is finished. This means that the elements we have just
seen are tightly linked together. For example if an XML file designated
by a <b>&lt;loadconfig&gt;</b>
contains a <b>&lt;default&gt;</b>
element, then after this file no other element will be evaluated. This
is because either a configuration was already found so the parsing
stops, or no configuration matched and the <b>&lt;default&gt;</b>
does, so the parsing ends.</p>
<p>The proper configuration is
contained in a <b>&lt;configForHost&gt;</b>
or <b>&lt;default&gt;</b>
element. It consists of the scheduled times for work and the hosts
where we register ourselves. Here is an example:</p>
<pre>&lt;periods&gt;<br> &lt;period&gt;<br> &lt;start day="monday" hour="18" minute="0"/&gt;<br> &lt;end day="tuesday" hour="6" minute="0"/&gt;<br> &lt;/period&gt;<br> &lt;period&gt;<br> &lt;start day="saturday" hour="0" minute="0"/&gt;<br> &lt;end day="monday" hour="6" minute="0"/&gt;<br> &lt;/period&gt;<br>&lt;/periods&gt;<br>&lt;register&gt;<br> &lt;registry url="trinidad.inria.fr"/&gt;<br> &lt;registry url="amda.inria.fr"/&gt;<br> &lt;registry url="tranquility.inria.fr"/&gt;<br> &lt;registry url="psychoquack.inria.fr"/&gt;<br>&lt;/register&gt;<br></pre>
<p>In this example we clearly see
that the JVM will wake up Monday evening and shut down Tuesday morning.
It will also work during the weekend. In the <b>&lt;register&gt;</b>
part we put the URL in which we will register ourselves, in the example
we used the short form which is equivalent to <i>rmi://host:9301</i>.</p>
<h4>Control</h4>
<ul>
  <li><b>Stop
the JVM</b>: This command will stop
the JVM and will restart it at the next scheduled time, which is the
day after:<br>
    <code>$
ProActive/p2p/build/p2pctl stop</code> </li>
  <li><b>Kill
the daemon</b>:<br>
    <code>$
ProActive/p2p/build/p2pctl killdaemon</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Under Windows you could use
some littles scripts in <code>ProActive/p2p/script/windows/JVM</code>
to do that.</p>

<h2><a name="appli"></a>Launch
your Application</h2>
<h3>Simple: Use ProActive XML
Deployment Descriptors</h3>
<p>You can customize some P2P
settings such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The number of node you want
from the P2P infrastructure. Setting <b>MAX</b>
as value is equivalent to an
infinite number of node. (attribute <b>nodesAsked</b>)</li>
  <li><b>host</b> that is the host name for starting a new P2P Service
or acquiring one if exists. By default, it's the local host.</li>
  <li><b>acq</b>
is the communication
protocol that's used to communicate with this P2P
Service. All ProActive communication protocols are supported: rmi,
http, etc. Default is rmi.</li>
  <li><b>port</b>
represents the port
number on which to start the P2P Service. Default
is 2410. The port is used by the communication protocol.</li>
  <li>The <b>NOA
Number
Of Acquaintances</b>
is the minimal number of peers one peer needs to know to keep up the
infrastructure. By default, its value is 10 peers.</li>
  <li>The <b>TTU
Time
To Update</b> each peer
sends an heart beat to its
acquaintances.
By default, its value is 1 minutes.</li>
  <li>The <b>TTL
Time
To Live</b>
represents messages live time in hops of JVMs (node). By default, its
value is 5 hops.</li>
</ul>
<p>With elements <b>acq</b>
and <b>port</b>&nbsp;
if a P2P Service is already
running with this configuration the descriptor will use this one
else a new one is started.
</p>
<p>In order to get nodes, the
<b>peerSet</b>
tag will allow you to specify entry point of your P2P
Infrastructure, where ProActive should ask for node. </p>
<p> You can get nodes from the P2P
Infrastructure using the ProActive Deployement Descriptor as described
above. <br>
In fact you will ask for a certain number of nodes and ProActive will
notify a "listener" (one of your class), every time a new node is
available. </p>
<pre><span class="java"> ProActiveDescriptor pad = ProActive.getProactiveDescriptor("myP2PXmlDescriptor.xml");</span><br
 class="java"><br class="java"><span class="java"> // getting virtual node "p2pvn" defined in the ProActive Deployement Descriptor</span><br
 class="java"><span class="java"> VirtualNode vn = pad.getVirtualNode("p2pvn");</span><br
 class="java"><span class="java"> </span><br class="java"><span
 class="java"> // adding "this" or anyother class has a listener of the "NodeCreationEvent"</span><br
 class="java"><span class="java"> ((VirtualNodeImpl) vn).addNodeCreationEventListener(this);</span><br
 class="java"><br class="java"><span class="java"> //activate that virtual node</span><br
 class="java"><span class="java"> vn.activate();</span><br></pre>
<p>As you can see the class
executing this code, must implements an interface in order to be
notified when a new node is available from the P2P infrastructure.<br>
Basically you will have to implement the interface
NodeCreationEventListener that can be found in package
org.objectweb.proactive.core.event For example this method will be
called every time a new host is acquired : </p>
<pre> public void nodeCreated(NodeCreationEvent event) <br> {<br> // get the node<br> Node newNode = event.getNode();<br><br>	// now you can create an active object on your node.<br> }<br> </pre>
<p>You should carefully notice
that you can be notified at any time, whatever the code you are
executing, once you have activated the virtual node.</p>
<p>A short preview of a XML
descriptor:</p>
<pre>	&lt;infrastructure&gt;<br>		&lt;/processes&gt;<br>			&lt;services&gt;<br>				&lt;serviceDefinition id="p2pservice"&gt;<br>					&lt;P2PService nodesAsked="2" acq="rmi" port="2410" NOA="10" TTU="60000" TTL="10"&gt;<br>						&lt;peerSet&gt;<br>							&lt;peer&gt;rmi://localhost:3000&lt;/peer&gt;<br>						&lt;/peerSet&gt;<br>				&lt;/P2PService&gt;<br>			&lt;/serviceDefinition&gt;<br>		&lt;/services&gt;<br>	&lt;/infrastructure&gt;<br> </pre>
<p>A complete example of file is
available <a href="p2p_files/sample_p2p.xml">here</a>.</p>

<h3>Access from your Application
to the P2P Infrastructure</h3>
<p>The next little sample of code
explains how from an application you can start a P2P Service and deploy
on it ProActive nodes:</p>
<pre><code><br>import org.objectweb.proactive.ProActive;<br>import org.objectweb.proactive.core.ProActiveException;<br>import org.objectweb.proactive.core.mop.ClassNotReifiableException;<br>import org.objectweb.proactive.core.node.Node;<br>import org.objectweb.proactive.core.node.NodeException;<br>import org.objectweb.proactive.core.node.NodeFactory;<br>import org.objectweb.proactive.core.runtime.ProActiveRuntime;<br>import org.objectweb.proactive.core.runtime.RuntimeFactory;<br>import org.objectweb.proactive.p2p.core.service.P2PService;<br>import org.objectweb.proactive.p2p.core.service.StartP2PService;<br>...<br>// This constructor uses a file with address of peers<br>// See the Javadoc to choose different paramaters<br>StartP2PService startServiceP2P = new StartP2PService(p2pFile)<br><br>// Start the P2P Service on the local host<br>startServiceP2P.start();<br><br>// Get the reference on the P2P Service<br>P2PService serviceP2P = startServiceP2P.getP2PService();<br><br>// By the application's P2P Service ask to the P2P infrastructure<br>// for get nodes.<br>P2PNodesLookup p2pNodesLookup = p2pService.getNodes(nNodes,<br>                        virtualNodeName, JobID);<br>// Use method from p2pNodeLookup to get nodes<br>...<br></code></pre>
