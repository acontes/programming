     * Unlike the 'like Current' construction of the Eiffel language, it is difficult in Java to
     * create an object of the same type as the current object without using heavy mechanisms of the
     * Reflection API. This is why we cannot completely reuse class BinaryTree because it contains
     * an explicit call to the constructor of class BinaryTree, then creating a passive object where
     * we want an active one This is why we here override the createChildren method in order to
     * ensure that all the nodes of the binary tree are active objects This of course is a bulky
     * implementation, and we could provide a more subtle scheme, such as creating active objects
     * only for a given depth n of the tree (so that there cannot be more that 2**n active objects)
