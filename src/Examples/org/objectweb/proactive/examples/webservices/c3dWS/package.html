C3D is both a collaborative application and a distributed
raytracer: users can interact through messaging and voting
facilities in order to choose a scene that is renderer using a set
of distributed rendering engines working in parallel. Near-linear
speedup is achieved with up to half a dozen rendering engines
running in parallel and communicating using ProActive.
</p><p>
There is a benchmark version that is an automation of C3D,
measuring the performance of a 3D raytracer renderer distributed over
several Java virtual machines.
This benchmark gives indication of the performance of ProActive,
the serialization process, and Java RMI itself.
</p>
<p>
This ws modified version has some new features like : <ul>
<li>the dispatcher is exposed as a web service</li>
<li>possibility of creating a .NET user</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
<b>Implementation : </b><br>
The C3DUSER class has been used as a template to create the other users : PAUser, WSUser.
This should be reimplemented when time comes.
