Poisson-3D cubic partitioning implementation

Arguments: 
size_x size_y size_z cluster_geom_x cluster_geom_y cluster_geom_z workers_geom_x workers_geom_y workers_geom_z maxit


- size_(x|y|z) are the GLOBAL matrix size for each axis.
- cluster_geom_(x|y|z) is the 'geometry' at cluster level partitioning.
-- Geometry '1 2 1' means the application uses 2 clusters (x*y*z). The matrix being divided in 2 subdomainsalong its 'y' axis
- workers_geom_(x|y|z) is the 'geometry' at worker level partitioning for EACH clusters.
-- This means each clusters must have the same worker geometry and thus the same number of workers.
   Geometry '2 2 1' means the cluster uses 4 workers and partitions the cluster sub-matrix along 'x' and 'y' axis.

NOTE:
	According to previous examples the total number of workers is the number of clusters given by
	(cluster_geom_x * cluster_geom_y * cluster_geom_z) multiplied by (workers_geom_x * workers_geom_y * workers_geom_z)
  
* Timer can be setted by enabling the TIMED  macro
* memory is dynamically allocated (i.e. no memory wasted by static array known at compile time)


Notes:

* It is important that each cluster have the same number of nodes !!
