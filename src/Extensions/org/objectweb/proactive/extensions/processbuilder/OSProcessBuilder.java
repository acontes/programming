     * fail with {@link UnsupportedOperationException} or
     * {@link IllegalArgumentException} if the modification is not permitted by
     * the operating system.

     * <p>
     * Since the external format of environment variable names and values is
     * system-dependent, there may not be a one-to-one mapping between them and
     * Java's Unicode strings. Nevertheless, the map is implemented in such a
     * way that environment variables which are not modified by Java code will
     * have an unmodified native representation in the subprocess.
     * 
     * <p>
     * The returned map and its collection views may not obey the general
     * contract of the {@link Object#equals} and {@link Object#hashCode}

         * case an exception is thrown, and the launching is abandoned), or the
         * receiving of the OK message. If the OK message was received then the
         * standard output will be read until the receiving of the OK message.
         * This way we ensure that the user will not see any output coming from
         * the native scripts, and the launching will be similar to a java.exec
         * call. <br>
         * <b>Do not</b> output to std.out from the native scripts as it could
         * dead-block the process (if the buffer fills up)! - of course, after
         * the user's command starts executing it is not this method's job to
         * deal with the two channels, thus everything goes back to 'normal'.
