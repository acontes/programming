 * class, and therefore refer to its documentation.
 * <p>
 * Some operations may be limited according to the caller's context and granted privileges, see
 * {@link PADataSpaces} documentation for the details.
 * <p>
 * All implementors must provide equals method logic. Two DataSpacesFileObject as equal if their URI
 * strings are equal.
 * <p>
 * Instances of this class are not necessarily thread-safe, however it is safe to access the same
 * URI through different DataSpacesFileObject instances (like it happens when accessing the same URI
 * from different Active Objects). It is recommended to explicitly close each instance of this class
 * after usage to make sure that resources are released, preferably in try-finally section.
