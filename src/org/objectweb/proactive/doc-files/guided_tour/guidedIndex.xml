  <title>ProActive guided tour</title>

  <!--  File: /home/irosenbe/PA_new_doc/docbook-tuto/guided_tour/index.html  -->

  <para>This tour is a practical introduction to ProActive, giving an
  illustrated introduction to some of the functionnalities and facilities
  offered by the library.</para>

  <para>First off, we give an explaination on how to install and configure
  ProActive. Next are introduced the different functionalities of the library
  through some runnning examples. Then are given some details on how this is
  put down in code, and you will be challenged to write your bits of code.
  This should give you practical experience on how to program using ProActive.
  A section on OO-SPMD (Object-Oriented Single Program Multiple Data) will
  show how to use this programming paradigm.</para>

  <para>The guided tour is finished off by the complete N-Body example. This
  application is first written trivially, then some speed-ups are plugged in,
  to show how ProActive can help you. We hope this will help your
  understanding of the library, and of the concepts driving it.</para>

  <para>If you need further details on how the examples work, check the
  ProActive <ulink

    for downloading and installing ProActive.</para>

    <para>The programming exercises in the first part imply that you:</para>

      <listitem>
        <para>Don't forget to add the required libraries to your classpath
        (i.e. the libraries contained in the ProActive/lib directory, as well
        as either the proactive.jar archive, or the compiled classes of
        proactive (better if you modify the source code)</para>

    <para>Set the CLASSPATH as follow, putting on one line:</para>

    <para>Under linux:</para>

    <para><screen>export CLASSPATH=.:./ProActive_examples.jar:./ProActive.jar:./lib/bcel.jar:
./lib/asm.jar:./lib/log4j.jar:./lib/xercesImpl.jar:
./lib/components/fractal.jar:./lib/bouncycastle.jar</screen></para>

    <para>Under windows:</para>

    <para>Concerning <emphasis role="underline">the second part</emphasis> of
    the tutorial (examples of some functionalities):</para>

      <listitem>
        <para>Note that the compilation is managed by <ulink
        url="http://jakarta.apache.org/ant">Ant</ulink> ; we suggest you use
        this tool to make modifications to the source code, while doing this
        tutorial. Nevertheless, you can just change the code and compile using
        compile.sh &lt;the example application&gt; (or compile.bat under
        windows)</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>The examples used in the second part of this tutorial are
        provided in the /scripts directory of the distribution.</para>

        <para>The scripts are platform dependant: .sh files on linux are
        equivalent to the .bat files on windows</para>
