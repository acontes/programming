    <para>Computing Grids and Peer-to-Peer networks are inherently heterogeneous and
 distributed, and for this reason they drive new technological challenges: complexity in the
 design of applications, complexity of deployment, reusability and performance issues. The
 objective of our work is to provide an answer to these problems through the implementation for
 ProActive of an extensible, dynamical and hierarchical component model, 
 <ulink url="http://fractal.objectweb.org">Fractal</ulink>. This document is an overview of the implementation of
 Fractal with ProActive. First, it explains the goals and the reasons for a new implementation of
 the Fractal model. Second, it shows the extensions to the model and the conformance to the
 Fractal specification. The third section is a word on the current Architecture Description
 Language. The fourth section goes through some examples to illustrate the use of the API and the
 distribution of components. The final section is about our forthcoming research work. You can
 also get an overview of the architecture of this implementation

 presented at the International Symposium on Distributed Objects and Applications (DOA), in
 November 2003.
