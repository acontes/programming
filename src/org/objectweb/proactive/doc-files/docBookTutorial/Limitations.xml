  <title>DocBok limitations imposed</title>

  <para>Here is described what is allowed in our docbook style. We restrict
  ourselves to a subset of docbook, because we want a uniform doc style, and
  want maintainable doc. To achieve this goal, we require minimum learning
  investment from our PA developers, who are meant to be coding, not spend
  there time writing doc. So you still want to add a fancy feature? Well, you
  can, as long as you describe how to use this new tag in this howto, and be
  extra careful with the pdf output.</para>

  <para>There will be a schema specifying which are the allowed tags. For now,
  all is legal, as this list is not written down yet.</para>
