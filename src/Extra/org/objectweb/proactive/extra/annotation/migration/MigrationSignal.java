/**
 * <p>This annotation can be used on a method that is a migration signal for an Active Object.
 * It is known that, in order to migrate, an Active Object must export a public method in which 
 * it must call the static method {@link org.objectweb.proactive.api.PAMobileAgent.migrateTo}. 
 * This is because the method call <code>PAMobileAgent.migrateTo</code> must be executed within the thread 
 * attached to the body of the Active Object that has to migrate. 
 * When a method is annotated with <code>@MigrationSignal</code> , the behaviour  is the following:
 * <ul>
 * 	<li> If the enclosing class definition is not annotated with the 
 * 		{@link org.objectweb.proactive.extra.annotation.activeobject.ActiveObject}
 * 		annotation, then we conclude that the user doesn't want to use the object 
 * 		as an active object, so migration has no meaning on this object. We signal this 
 * 		to the user.
 * 	</li>
 * 	<li> We check whether the method is public. It makes no sense for the method not to be public, 
 * as it is supposed to be called when we want to make a migration request on the active object.</li>
 * 	<li>
 * 		If the object is annotated with <code>ActiveObject</code>, then	we check if the annotated method 
 * 			contains a call to the moveTo method:
 * 		<ul>
 * 			<li> If the method code contains a call to moveTo, we check that this call 
 * 		is the last statement in the method body. If not, an error is signaled to the user</li> 
 * 			<li> If the method code does not contain a call to moveTo, the we inform the user that 
 * 		she should add the call at the end of the method body.
 * 			</li>
 * 		</ul>
 * 	</li> 
 * </ul>
