<h3>
Secure ProActive Message Routing
</h3>
<p>
This package provides a new ProActive protocol - pamrssh. This protocol improves pamr by passing all communication throught secure, ssh sockets.
</p>

	<p> The outline of the subpackages of this package was thought to be in correspondance with the logical grouping of subentities in the {@link org.objectweb.proactive.extra.messagerouting} package.</p>
