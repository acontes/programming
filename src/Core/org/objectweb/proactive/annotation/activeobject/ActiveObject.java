/**
 * <p>
 * This annotation is put on a class declaration, in order to mark that
 * it will be used to instantiate an active object, and therefore
 * should respect the active object guidelines.
 * </p>
 * <p>Usage:</p> 
 * 	<ul>
 * 		<li> When you create a class that you know you will use to instantiate an active object, annotate it using @ActiveObject</li>
 * 		<li> ProActive will check whether your object respect the ProActive coding guidelines - these can be found in the ProActive manual. 
 * 			You can take a look especially 
 * <a href="http://proactive.inria.fr/release-doc/html/ActiveObjectCreation.html#FutureObjectCreation_commonerror">here</a>.
 * 			The rules are enforced at compile time, in the following ways:
 * 			<ul>
 * 				<li>If you compile from the command line, you should first run <a href ="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/apt/index.html">apt</a> before compiling. 
 * By default, apt is included in the JDK distributions after 1.5, and is in the same directory as the javac.
 * You can invoke apt just as you invoke javac, using the same javac settings.
 * 				</li>
 * 				<li> If you compile from Eclipse IDE, you can configure it to show you the errors while developping.
 * This can be done by modifying the project settings, in the Java Compiler -> Annotation Processing panel. Please refer to the 
 * <a href="TODO">section</a> in the ProActive manual in order to see how this is done.
 * 				</li>
 * 			</ul>   
 * 		</li>
 * 	</ul>
