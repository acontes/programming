/**
 * A logging event sender service.
 * 
 * To ease the deployment of distributed applications, a logging event sender
 * service can be used to centralize all the log4j logging events on a given
 * machine. Usually the machine who loaded the GCM Application descriptor also
 * host the log collector.
 * 
 * This service allows to use a custom service provider. It can be useful if the
 * default service provider does not match your expectation in term of
 * reliability, performances, or functionalities.
 * 
 * Each time a logging event is received by a {@link LoggingEventSenderSPI}, it
 * is forwarded to the logging event sender service through the
 * {@link LoggingEventSenderSPI#append(LoggingEvent)} method. This
 * event can be send to the collector immediately or buffered for later
 * delivery.
 * 
 * Since immediate sending has a dramatic impact on performances; it is often
 * better to send the logging events to collector in batch. It can be done in
 * the {@link LoggingEventSenderSPI#append(LoggingEvent)} method when a
 * condition is meet, or by using a dedicated daemon thread. A such thread is
 * started by the {@link ProActiveAppender}. Service providers must override
 * {@link LoggingEventSenderSPI#run} to define a flushing policy. If the daemon
 * flushing thread is not useful, then the method can do nothing.
 * 
 * It is critical to flush all known logging events before the JVM exit. A
 * shutdown hook will call the {@link LoggingEventSenderSPI#terminate()} method
 * to allow the service provider to flush all buffered logging events. This
 * method and the flushing thread can run concurrently. They must be properly
 * synchronized
