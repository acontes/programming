This package and sub-packages provide a customization of the standard 
Fractal ADL for ProActive. It uses standard classes and .fractal files
from the fractal-adl-2.4-SNAPSHOT.jar in the /lib directory, and from
a user point of view, main differences between the standard Fractal ADL
parser and this one are:
<br>
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		A different Launcher class that can work with ProActive
		deployment descriptor and GCM Application descriptor.
	</li>
	<li>A customized factory and compiler.</li>
	<li>
		A registry that can store references to instantiated components
		(not used for the moment).
	</li>
	<li>
		Virtual nodes in the ADL can find a mapping in the ProActive
		deployment descriptor or in the GCM Application descriptor.
	</li>
	<li>
		Virtual nodes can be exported and composed; this allows
		colocation of processes.
	</li>
	<li>The dtd is specific to ProActive.</li>
</ul>
<p/>
<p>The architecture of the Fractal ADL has been modified as follows:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The factory specifies the new compiler to use:</li>

</ul>
<ul>
  <li>
  	The compiler has a new exportedVirtualNode compiler, a custom
  	implementation compiler that considers virtual nodes, a new
  	exportedVirtualNode builder and a custom implementation builder
  	that handles virtual nodes and stores component instances into
  	a registry (not yet implemented):</li>
