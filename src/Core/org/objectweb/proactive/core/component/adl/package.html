This package and sub-packages provide a customization of the standard 
Fractal ADL for ProActive. It uses standard classes and .fractal files
from the fractal-adl.jar in the /lib directory, and from a user point of view, main 
differences between the standard Fractal ADL parser and this one are : 
      <br>

      
</p>
<ul>

	<li>a different Launcher class that can work with ProActive deployment descriptors</li>

	<li>customized factory and backend
	</li>
  <li>a registry that can store references to instantiated components</li>

	<li>virtual nodes in the ADL can find a mapping in the GCM Application descriptor.
	</li>
  <li>virtual nodes can be exported and composed ; this allows colocation of processes
	</li>
  <li>the dtd is specific to proactive
  </li>
</ul>

<p></p>


<p>The architecture of the Fractal ADL has been modified as follows :
</p>

<ul>
  <li>The factory specifies the new compiler and backend to use :</li>

<ul>
  <li>The compiler has a new exportedVirtualNode compiler, and a custom implementation compiler that considers virtual nodes :</li>

</ul>
<ul>
  <li>The backend has a new exportedVirtualNode builder and a custom
implementation builder that handles virtual nodes and stores component
instances into a registry.</li>
