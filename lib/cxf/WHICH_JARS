    This directory includes the CXF jar, the CXF manifest jar, the required
dependencies, and many optional dependencies. The "modules" directory
contains the cxf.jar split up into smaller pieces if you wish to use only
specific parts of CXF.

Jars marked with a [6] at the end are optional for Java 6 (update 4 or
later is supported) as the functionality provided by those jars are
provided in the JDK.

supported.
